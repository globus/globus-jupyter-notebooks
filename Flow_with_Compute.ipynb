    "# Flow with a Compute Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to construct a Globus Flow that includes a Globus Compute function call. Our flow will **scan a folder** in a Globus collection and **ingest the list of files** into a new entry in a search index. We'll use Globus Compute to **prepare the folder listing** for ingest into the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of the notebook is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import required Python modules and specify the search index and compute endpoint to be used.\n",
    "2. Authenticate with Globus and create Globus SDK FlowsClient object.\n",
    "3. **Define the function** and **register it** with Globus Compute (to get a UUID).\n",
    "4. **Define and deploy** the Flow.\n",
    "5. **Run the flow** with a Globus collection and path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time the flow is run, a new entry will be created in the search index. We'll use a **simple web application** to display the contents of the index so we can see entries appear as tutorial participants run their flows!"
