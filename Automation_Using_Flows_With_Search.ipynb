    "In this notebook we demonstrate how the Globus Flow service can be used to automate data management at scale, with data discovery as a key aspect of the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate a flow that automates a common design pattern: \n",
    "1. moving data from one system to another \n",
    "2. making the data accessible to collaborators \n",
    "3. publishing the metadata to a search index for discovery \n",
    "\n",
    "The Globus flow is illustrated below.\n",

    "\n",
    "This flow is often needed to manage data coming from instruments, e.g., image files can be moved from local storage attached to a microscope (acquisition machine) to a high-performance storage system where they may be accessed by all members of the research project. Metdata is gathered and pushed to a search index, with support for some metadata discoverable by anyone and other metadata available only to collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk through the following tasks:\n",
    "1. Authenticate with Globus and get tokens for accessing various services.\n",
    "1. Create a search index to publish metadata to, if it does not already exist\n",
    "1. Define and register a flow with Globus that has the steps decribed above\n",
    "1. Execute a flow using configurable inputs for the collections and the access permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we'll grant access to the [Tutorial Users group](https://app.globus.org/groups/50b6a29c-63ac-11e4-8062-22000ab68755/about))."

    "1. When executing a flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to the Flows service is already granted to you by virtue of authenticating to the JupyterHub running this notebook. Note: If you're running this notebook in your own environment you will need to manually log into Globus Auth and get tokens using a native app authorization flow (see the `Platform_Introduction_Native_App_Auth` notebook for an example of how to initiate this flow)."
