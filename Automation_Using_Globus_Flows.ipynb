    "In this notebook we demonstrate how the Globus Flow service can be used to automate data management at scale. We demonstrate a flow that automates a common design pattern: moving data from one system to another and making the data accessible to collaborators. This flow is often needed to manage data coming from instruments, e.g., image files can be moved from local storage attached to a microscope to a high-performance storage system where they may be accessed by all members of the research project (in our example, we'll grant access to the [Tutorial Users group](https://app.globus.org/groups/50b6a29c-63ac-11e4-8062-22000ab68755/about)).\n",

    "1. Authenticate with Globus and get tokens for accessing various services.\n",
    "1. Define and register a flow with Globus.\n",
