You can setup your own endpoint on resources to which you have access by following the [Globus Compute documentation](https://globus-compute.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endpoints.html). Globus Compute endpoints can be deployed on many cloud platforms, clusters with batch schedulers (e.g., Slurm, PBS), Kubernetes, or on a local PC. After configuring an endpoint you can use it in this tutorial by simply setting the `endpoint_id` below."
